# week-4-game
This a game where crystals will be displayed as buttons for the user with random values assigned to each crystal between 1-12.  The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game between 19-120.  

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.  The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.  When the user clicks a crystal, the player's score will update the counter.  

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.  The player loses if their score goes above the random number.  

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
